## 🚀 Why I Made This

I'm currently working as a Flutter developer and learning Dart from scratch. This repo is:
- My personal **learning tracker**
- A way to **revise & explain to myself**
- A resource for **anyone else who's also learning Dart**

Feel free to explore or contribute if you're on the same journey.
